A sprite sheet is a series of images (usually\n\t * animation frames) combined into a larger image (or images). For example, an animation consisting of eight 100x100\n\t * images could be combined into a single 400x200 sprite sheet (4 frames across by 2 high).\n\t *\n\t * The data passed to the SpriteSheet constructor defines:\n\t * <ol>\n\t * \t<li> The source image or images to use.</li>\n\t * \t<li> The positions of individual image frames.</li>\n\t * \t<li> Sequences of frames that form named animations. Optional.</li>\n\t * \t<li> The target playback framerate. Optional.</li>\n\t * </ol>\n\t * <h3>SpriteSheet Format</h3>\n\t * SpriteSheets are an object with two required properties (`images` and `frames`), and two optional properties\n\t * (`framerate` and `animations`). This makes them easy to define in javascript code, or in JSON.\n\t *\n\t * <h4>images</h4>\n\t * An array of source images. Images can be either an HTMlimage\n\t * instance, or a uri to an image. The former is recommended to control preloading.\n\t *\n\t * \timages: [image1, \"path/to/image2.png\"],\n\t *\n\t * <h4>frames</h4>\n\t * Defines the individual frames. There are two supported formats for frame data:\n\t * When all of the frames are the same size (in a grid), use an object with `width`, `height`, `regX`, `regY`,\n\t * and `count` properties.\n\t *\n\t * <ul>\n\t *  <li>`width` & `height` are required and specify the dimensions of the frames</li>\n\t *  <li>`regX` & `regY` indicate the registration point or \"origin\" of the frames</li>\n\t *  <li>`spacing` indicate the spacing between frames</li>\n\t *  <li>`margin` specify the margin around the image(s)</li>\n\t *  <li>`count` allows you to specify the total number of frames in the spritesheet; if omitted, this will\n\t *  be calculated based on the dimensions of the source images and the frames. Frames will be assigned\n\t *  indexes based on their position in the source images (left to right, top to bottom).</li>\n\t * </ul>\n\t *\n\t *  \tframes: {width:64, height:64, count:20, regX: 32, regY:64, spacing:0, margin:0}\n\t *\n\t * If the frames are of different sizes, use an array of frame definitions. Each definition is itself an array\n\t * with 4 required and 3 optional entries, in the order:\n\t *\n\t * <ul>\n\t *  <li>The first four, `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height` are required and define the frame rectangle.</li>\n\t *  <li>The fifth, `imageIndex`, specifies the index of the source image (defaults to 0)</li>\n\t *  <li>The last two, `regX` and `regY` specify the registration point of the frame</li>\n\t * </ul>\n\t *\n\t * \tframes: [\n\t * \t\t// x, y, width, height, imageIndex*, regX*, regY*\n\t * \t\t[64, 0, 96, 64],\n\t * \t\t[0, 0, 64, 64, 1, 32, 32]\n\t * \t\t// etc.\n\t * \t]\n\t *\n\t * <h4>animations</h4>\n\t * Optional. An object defining sequences of frames to play as named animations. Each property corresponds to an\n\t * animation of the same name. Each animation must specify the frames to play, and may\n\t * also include a relative playback `speed` (ex. 2 would playback at double speed, 0.5 at half), and\n\t * the name of the `next` animation to sequence to after it completes.\n\t *\n\t * There are three formats supported for defining the frames in an animation, which can be mixed and matched as appropriate:\n\t * <ol>\n\t * \t<li>for a single frame animation, you can simply specify the frame index\n\t *\n\t * \t\tanimations: {\n\t * \t\t\tsit: 7\n\t * \t\t}\n\t *\n\t * </li>\n\t * <li>\n\t *      for an animation of consecutive frames, you can use an array with two required, and two optional entries\n\t * \t\tin the order: `start`, `end`, `next`, and `speed`. This will play the frames from start to end inclusive.\n\t *\n\t * \t\tanimations: {\n\t * \t\t\t// start, end, next*, speed*\n\t * \t\t\trun: [0, 8],\n\t * \t\t\tjump: [9, 12, \"run\", 2]\n\t * \t\t}\n\t *\n\t *  </li>\n\t *  <li>\n\t *     for non-consecutive frames, you can use an object with a `frames` property defining an array of frame\n\t *     indexes to play in order. The object can also specify `next` and `speed` properties.\n\t *\n\t * \t\tanimations: {\n\t * \t\t\twalk: {\n\t * \t\t\t\tframes: [1,2,3,3,2,1]\n\t * \t\t\t},\n\t * \t\t\tshoot: {\n\t * \t\t\t\tframes: [1,4,5,6],\n\t * \t\t\t\tnext: \"walk\",\n\t * \t\t\t\tspeed: 0.5\n\t * \t\t\t}\n\t * \t\t}\n\t *\n\t *  </li>\n\t * </ol>\n\t * <strong>Note:</strong> the `speed` property was added in EaselJS 0.7.0. Earlier versions had a `frequency`\n\t * property instead, which was the inverse of `speed`. For example, a value of \"4\" would be 1/4 normal speed in\n\t * earlier versions, but is 4x normal speed in EaselJS 0.7.0+.\n\t *\n\t * <h4>framerate</h4>\n\t * Optional. Indicates the default framerate to play this spritesheet at in frames per second. See\n\t * {{#crossLink \"SpriteSheet/framerate:property\"}}{{/crossLink}} for more information.\n\t *\n\t * \t\tframerate: 20\n\t *\n\t * Note that the Sprite framerate will only work if the stage update method is provided with the {{#crossLink \"Ticker/tick:event\"}}{{/crossLink}}\n\t * event generated by the {{#crossLink \"Ticker\"}}{{/crossLink}}.\n\t *\n\t * \t\tcreatejs.Ticker.on(\"tick\", handleTick);\n\t * \t\tfunction handleTick(event) {\n\t *\t\t\tstage.update(event);\n\t *\t\t}\n\t *\n\t * <h3>Example</h3>\n\t * To define a simple sprite sheet, with a single image \"sprites.jpg\" arranged in a regular 50x50 grid with three\n\t * animations: \"stand\" showing the first frame, \"run\" looping frame 1-5 inclusive, and \"jump\" playing frame 6-8 and\n\t * sequencing back to run.\n\t *\n\t * \t\tvar data = {\n\t * \t\t\timages: [\"sprites.jpg\"],\n\t * \t\t\tframes: {width:50, height:50},\n\t * \t\t\tanimations: {\n\t * \t\t\t\tstand:0,\n\t * \t\t\t\trun:[1,5],\n\t * \t\t\t\tjump:[6,8,\"run\"]\n\t * \t\t\t}\n\t * \t\t};\n\t * \t\tvar spriteSheet = new createjs.SpriteSheet(data);\n\t * \t\tvar animation = new createjs.Sprite(spriteSheet, \"run\");\n\t *\n\t * <h3>Generating SpriteSheet Images</h3>\n\t * Spritesheets can be created manually by combining images in PhotoShop, and specifying the frame size or\n\t * coordinates manually, however there are a number of tools that facilitate this.\n\t * <ul>\n\t *     <li>Exporting SpriteSheets or HTML5 content from Adobe Flash/Animate supports the EaselJS SpriteSheet format.</li>\n\t *     <li>The popular <a href=\"https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker/easeljs\" target=\"_blank\">Texture Packer</a> has\n\t *     EaselJS support.\n\t *     <li>SWF animations in Adobe Flash/Animate can be exported to SpriteSheets using <a href=\"http://createjs.com/zoe\" target=\"_blank\">Zo&euml;</a></li>\n\t * </ul>\n\t *\n\t * <h3>Cross Origin Issues</h3>\n\t * <strong>Warning:</strong> Images loaded cross-origin will throw cross-origin security errors when interacted with\n\t * using:\n\t * <ul>\n\t *     <li>a mouse</li>\n\t *     <li>methods such as {{#crossLink \"Container/getObjectUnderPoint\"}}{{/crossLink}}</li>\n\t *     <li>Filters (see {{#crossLink \"Filter\"}}{{/crossLink}})</li>\n\t *     <li>caching (see {{#crossLink \"DisplayObject/cache\"}}{{/crossLink}})</li>\n\t * </ul>\n\t * You can get around this by setting `crossOrigin` property on your images before passing them to EaselJS, or\n\t * setting the `crossOrigin` property on PreloadJS' LoadQueue or LoadItems.\n\t *\n\t * \t\tvar image = new Image();\n\t * \t\timg.crossOrigin=\"Anonymous\";\n\t * \t\timg.src = \"http://server-with-CORS-support.com/path/to/image.jpg\";\n\t *\n\t * If you pass string paths to SpriteSheets, they will not work cross-origin.

Note that you can use Graphics without any dependency on the EaselJS framework by calling {{#crossLink \"Graphics/draw\"}}{{/crossLink}}\n\t * directly, or it can be used with the {{#crossLink \"Shape\"}}{{/crossLink}} object to draw vector graphics within the\n\t * context of an EaselJS display list.\n\t *\n\t * There are two approaches to working with Graphics object: calling methods on a Graphics instance (the \"Graphics API\"), or\n\t * instantiating Graphics command objects and adding them to the graphics queue via {{#crossLink \"Graphics/append\"}}{{/crossLink}}.\n\t * The former abstracts the latter, simplifying beginning and ending paths, fills, and strokes.\n\t *\n\t *      var g = new createjs.Graphics();\n\t *      g.setStrokeStyle(1);\n\t *      g.beginStroke(\"#000000\");\n\t *      g.beginFill(\"red\");\n\t *      g.drawCircle(0,0,30);\n\t *\n\t * All drawing methods in Graphics return the Graphics instance, so they can be chained together. For example,\n\t * the following line of code would generate the instructions to draw a rectangle with a red stroke and blue fill:\n\t *\n\t *      myGraphics.beginStroke(\"red\").beginFill(\"blue\").drawRect(20, 20, 100, 50);\n\t *\n\t * Each graphics API call generates a command object (see below). The last command to be created can be accessed via\n\t * {{#crossLink \"Graphics/command:property\"}}{{/crossLink}}:\n\t *\n\t *      var fillCommand = myGraphics.beginFill(\"red\").command;\n\t *      // ... later, update the fill style/color:\n\t *      fillCommand.style = \"blue\";\n\t *      // or change it to a bitmap fill:\n\t *      fillCommand.bitmap(myImage);\n\t *\n\t * For more direct control of rendering, you can instantiate and append command objects to the graphics queue directly. In this case, you\n\t * need to manage path creation manually, and ensure that fill/stroke is applied to a defined path:\n\t *\n\t *      // start a new path. Graphics.beginCmd is a reusable BeginPath instance:\n\t *      myGraphics.append(createjs.Graphics.beginCmd);\n\t *      // we need to define the path before applying the fill:\n\t *      var circle = new createjs.Graphics.Circle(0,0,30);\n\t *      myGraphics.append(circle);\n\t *      // fill the path we just defined:\n\t *      var fill = new createjs.Graphics.Fill(\"red\");\n\t *      myGraphics.append(fill);\n\t *\n\t * These approaches can be used together, for example to insert a custom command:\n\t *\n\t *      myGraphics.beginFill(\"red\");\n\t *      var customCommand = new CustomSpiralCommand(etc);\n\t *      myGraphics.append(customCommand);\n\t *      myGraphics.beginFill(\"blue\");\n\t *      myGraphics.drawCircle(0, 0, 30);\n\t *\n\t * See {{#crossLink \"Graphics/append\"}}{{/crossLink}} for more info on creating custom commands.\n\t *\n\t * <h4>Tiny API</h4>\n\t * The Graphics class also includes a \"tiny API\", which is one or two-letter methods that are shortcuts for all of the\n\t * Graphics methods. These methods are great for creating compact instructions, and is used by the Toolkit for CreateJS\n\t * to generate readable code. All tiny methods are marked as protected, so you can view them by enabling protected\n\t * descriptions in the docs.\n\t *\n\t * <table>\n\t *     <tr><td><b>Tiny</b></td><td><b>Method</b></td><td><b>Tiny</b></td><td><b>Method</b></td></tr>\n\t *     <tr><td>mt</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/moveTo\"}}{{/crossLink}} </td>\n\t *     <td>lt</td> <td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/lineTo\"}}{{/crossLink}}</td></tr>\n\t *     <tr><td>a/at</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/arc\"}}{{/crossLink}} / {{#crossLink \"Graphics/arcTo\"}}{{/crossLink}} </td>\n\t *     <td>bt</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/bezierCurveTo\"}}{{/crossLink}} </td></tr>\n\t *     <tr><td>qt</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/quadraticCurveTo\"}}{{/crossLink}} (also curveTo)</td>\n\t *     <td>r</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/rect\"}}{{/crossLink}} </td></tr>\n\t *     <tr><td>cp</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/closePath\"}}{{/crossLink}} </td>\n\t *     <td>c</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/clear\"}}{{/crossLink}} </td></tr>\n\t *     <tr><td>f</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/beginFill\"}}{{/crossLink}} </td>\n\t *     <td>lf</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/beginLinearGradientFill\"}}{{/crossLink}} </td></tr>\n\t *     <tr><td>rf</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/beginRadialGradientFill\"}}{{/crossLink}} </td>\n\t *     <td>bf</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/beginBitmapFill\"}}{{/crossLink}} </td></tr>\n\t *     <tr><td>ef</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/endFill\"}}{{/crossLink}} </td>\n\t *     <td>ss / sd</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/setStrokeStyle\"}}{{/crossLink}} / {{#crossLink \"Graphics/setStrokeDash\"}}{{/crossLink}} </td></tr>\n\t *     <tr><td>s</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/beginStroke\"}}{{/crossLink}} </td>\n\t *     <td>ls</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/beginLinearGradientStroke\"}}{{/crossLink}} </td></tr>\n\t *     <tr><td>rs</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/beginRadialGradientStroke\"}}{{/crossLink}} </td>\n\t *     <td>bs</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/beginBitmapStroke\"}}{{/crossLink}} </td></tr>\n\t *     <tr><td>es</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/endStroke\"}}{{/crossLink}} </td>\n\t *     <td>dr</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/drawRect\"}}{{/crossLink}} </td></tr>\n\t *     <tr><td>rr</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/drawRoundRect\"}}{{/crossLink}} </td>\n\t *     <td>rc</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/drawRoundRectComplex\"}}{{/crossLink}} </td></tr>\n\t *     <tr><td>dc</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/drawCircle\"}}{{/crossLink}} </td>\n\t *     <td>de</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/drawEllipse\"}}{{/crossLink}} </td></tr>\n\t *     <tr><td>dp</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/drawPolyStar\"}}{{/crossLink}} </td>\n\t *     <td>p</td><td>{{#crossLink \"Graphics/decodePath\"}}{{/crossLink}} </td></tr>\n\t * </table>\n\t *\n\t * Here is the above example, using the tiny API instead.\n\t *\n\t *      myGraphics.s(\"red\").f(\"blue\").r(20, 20, 100, 50);\n\t *\n\t * @class Graphics\n\t * @constructor\n\t **/\n\tfunction Graphics() {\n\n\n\t// public properties\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * Holds a reference to the last command that was created or appended.

This class should behave identically to\n\t * a {{#crossLink \"Stage\"}}{{/crossLink}} except for WebGL-specific functionality.\n\t *\n\t * Each time the {{#crossLink \"Stage/tick\"}}{{/crossLink}} method is called, the display list is rendered to the\n\t * target &lt;canvas/&gt; instance, ignoring non-WebGL-compatible display objects.

Each graphics card has a limit to its concurrent Textures, too many \n\t * Textures will noticeably slow performance.\n\t * - Each cache counts as an individual Texture. As such {{#crossLink \"SpriteSheet\"}}{{/crossLink}} and \n\t * {{#crossLink \"SpriteSheetBuilder\"}}{{/crossLink}} are recommended practices to help keep texture counts low.\n\t * - To use any image node (DOM Image/Canvas Element) between multiple StageGL instances it must be a \n\t * {{#crossLink \"Bitmap/clone\"}}{{/crossLink}}, otherwise the GPU texture loading and tracking will get confused.\n\t * - to avoid an up/down scaled render you must call {{#crossLink \"StageGL/updateViewport\"}}{{/crossLink}} if you\n\t * resize your canvas after making a StageGL instance, this will properly size the WebGL context stored in memory.\n\t * - Best performance in demanding scenarios will come from manual management of texture memory, but it is handled\n\t * automatically by default.

The grey shape starts on the left, but we jump to a mid-point in\n\t * the animation using {{#crossLink \"MovieClip/gotoAndPlay\"}}{{/crossLink}}.\n\t *\n\t *      var stage = new createjs.Stage(\"canvas\");\n\t *      createjs.Ticker.addEventListener(\"tick\", stage);\n\t *\n\t *      var mc = new createjs.MovieClip({loop:-1, labels:{myLabel:20}});\n\t *      stage.addChild(mc);\n\t *\n\t *      var child1 = new createjs.Shape(\n\t *          new createjs.Graphics().beginFill(\"#999999\")\n\t *              .drawCircle(30,30,30));\n\t *      var child2 = new createjs.Shape(\n\t *          new createjs.Graphics().beginFill(\"#5a9cfb\")\n\t *              .drawCircle(30,30,30));\n\t *\n\t *      mc.timeline.addTween(\n\t *          createjs.Tween.get(child1)\n\t *              .to({x:0}).to({x:60}, 50).to({x:0}, 50));\n\t *      mc.timeline.addTween(\n\t *          createjs.Tween.get(child2)\n\t *              .to({x:60}).to({x:0}, 50).to({x:60}, 50));\n\t *\n\t *      mc.gotoAndPlay(\"start\");\n\t *\n\t * It is recommended to use <code>tween.to()</code> to animate and set properties (use no duration to have it set\n\t * immediately), and the <code>tween.wait()</code> method to create delays between animations.

Caching and it's benefits are discussed\n\t * by the {{#crossLink \"DisplayObject/cache\"}}{{/crossLink}} function and this class description. Here are the detailed\n\t * specifics of how to use the options object.\n\t *\n\t * - If options.useGL is set to \"new\" a StageGL is created and contained on this for use when rendering the cache.\n\t * - If options.useGL is set to \"stage\" if the current stage is a StageGL it will be used. If not then it will default to \"new\".\n\t * - If options.useGL is a StageGL instance it will not create one but use the one provided.\n\t * - If options.useGL is undefined a Context 2D cache will be performed.\n\t *\n\t * This means you can use any combination of StageGL and 2D with either, neither, or both the stage and cache being\n\t * WebGL. Using \"new\" with a StageGL display list is highly unrecommended, but still an option. It should be avoided\n\t * due to negative performance reasons and the Image loading limitation noted in the class complications above.\n\t *\n\t * When \"options.useGL\" is set to the parent stage of the target and WebGL, performance is increased by using\n\t * \"RenderTextures\" instead of canvas elements. These are internal Textures on the graphics card stored in the GPU.\n\t * Because they are no longer canvases you cannot perform operations you could with a regular canvas. The benefit\n\t * is that this avoids the slowdown of copying the texture back and forth from the GPU to a Canvas element.\n\t * This means \"stage\" is the recommended option when available.\n\t *\n\t * A StageGL cache does not infer the ability to draw objects a StageGL cannot currently draw, i.e. do not use a\n\t * WebGL context cache when caching a Shape, Text, etc.\n\t * <h4>WebGL cache with a 2D context</h4>\n\t *\n\t *     var stage = new createjs.Stage();\n\t *     var bmp = new createjs.Bitmap(src);\n\t *     bmp.cache(0, 0, bmp.width, bmp.height, 1, {gl: \"new\"});          // no StageGL to use, so make one\n\t *\n\t *     var shape = new createjs.Shape();\n\t *     shape.graphics.clear().fill(\"red\").drawRect(0,0,20,20);\n\t *     shape.cache(0, 0, 20, 20, 1);                             // cannot use WebGL cache\n\t *\n\t * <h4>WebGL cache with a WebGL context</h4>\n\t *\n\t *     var stageGL = new createjs.StageGL();\n\t *     var bmp = new createjs.Bitmap(src);\n\t *     bmp.cache(0, 0, bmp.width, bmp.height, 1, {gl: \"stage\"});       // use our StageGL to cache\n\t *\n\t *     var shape = new createjs.Shape();\n\t *     shape.graphics.clear().fill(\"red\").drawRect(0,0,20,20);\n\t *     shape.cache(0, 0, 20, 20, 1);                             // cannot use WebGL cache\n\t *\n\t * You may wish to create your own StageGL instance to control factors like clear color, transparency, AA, and\n\t * others. If you do, pass a new instance in instead of \"true\", the library will automatically set the\n\t * {{#crossLink \"StageGL/isCacheControlled\"}}{{/crossLink}} to true on your instance.
